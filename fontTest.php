        <p>I'm Tobias a vienna-based mostly digital designer. My superpowers lie in the fields of user interface and user experience design. Beside the digital work I also love to design print stuff. At the moment I'm switching my hometown pretty fast, due to the fact that I work at phios ag in Liechtenstein. That's it for now. </p>

        <p>
            I'll give you some starting points to discover my world. If you have a question or want to start any kind of project, don't hestitate just shoot me an email. If you want to look at my projects, this is the right way. Maybe you want to know a little bit more about me, so yeah here you go. Last but not least, there's also a resume to download, right here. If you are interested what excited me today, here is a collection of links which I put together for me and for you.

Just take a look at my projects. In my freetime I really like to go out and enjoy the beautiful nature in my hometown Schwarzenberg.
